# Counting with me
Let's count along!

## Description

This repo contains a "counter" React application that includes the following elements:
- A button with the label: "Increment"
- A button with the label: "Reset"
- A number prefixed by the label "Counter:"

Once the react page is loaded the number is set to 0. With every push on the "Increment" button this number increments by 1. Pushing the "Reset" counter resets the number to 0.

The page includes a stylesheet that applies two different colors to the buttons, one for the normal state, one for the hover state and one for the pressed state. Also the number shows a different color when it is 0. 

## API integration

The application also displays a random Chuck Norris joke everytime the Increment button is clicked
